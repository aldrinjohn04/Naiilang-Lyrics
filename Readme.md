# Naiilang Lyrics (Python Typing Animation)

This is a simple Python script that displays the lyrics of the song
\*\*\"Naiilang\"\*\* with a simulated typing animation. Each line
appears with a customizable typing speed and delay, making it feel like
the lyrics are being typed in real-time.

## 🐍 Features

- Typing animation using \`sys.stdout\` and \`time.sleep\` - Custom
typing speed and delay per line - Simple, clean terminal display

## 🛠️ How It Works

The lyrics are stored in a list of tuples: \`\`\`python (\"line of
lyrics\", typing_duration, after_delay) Each line is printed one
character at a time based on the typing_duration, then waits for the
after_delay before printing the next line.
